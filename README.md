Welcome to our  coding workshop! This repo contains all of our lessons and activities! You can always come back to this on your own, and review what we went over at any point!

In this ASPIRE, we are going to be learning core programming skills in Python, problem-solving, and gaining some great exposure to advanced ideas within programming to best prepare you for your future in computer science!

Where: The EDGE Lab

When:

Mondays:  7:15 - 8:15 am

Fridays:   8:30 - 9:30 am

## How To Use For The First Time

### 0. Make Sure You Have a GitHub Account

### 1. Fork the Workshop Repository

a. Click the "Fork" button (top right corner).

b. This creates your own copy of the repo in your GitHub account.

### 2. Open Your Fork in Codespaces

a. Click the green "Code" button

b. Click the "Codespaces" tab

c. Select "Create codespace on main"

(This opens a web-based VS Code editor)

### 3. Explore Our Activities

a. In the file browser (left side), expand the weekly_resources folder

b. Open the folder for this week

c. Edit and run that day's program (you can review that weeks lesson in the lesson_slides/ folder)

### 4. Set Up the Teacher's Repository as "Upstream"

This will let you get new lessons later.

a. Copy and Paste this into the Terminal:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/isabelleviraldo/Coding_Fundamentals_ASPIRE.git
```

### 5. EVERY WEEK Get The Latest Update

a. Open the Terminal

b. Copy and Paste this into the Terminal

```
git pull upstream main
```


## How to Quickly Open Your Codespace

Just press the period key on your device (this -> . )

## How To Open The Terminal

1. Go to the top left menu (3 horizontal bars) > Terminal > New Terminal (or just use ctrl + shift + c)

2. Continue Working in GitHub Codespaces

3. You will be prompted to choose the number of cores and amount of ram, this doesnt matter, so pick whichever (more is usually for bigger programs btw)
