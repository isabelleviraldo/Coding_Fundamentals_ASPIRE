# Library Book Manager

# Create a simple program to manage a list of books.
# Your program must include:
#   1. At least one while loop
#   2. At least one for loop
#   3. At least one list

# Libraries have to keep track of every book that they have in their locations, as well
# as the books that are out of their locations, and it needs to be editable because people
# check books in and out all the time, so try to build something that matches the real
# world libraries as best you can

# Also, dont stress, this is just a little program, nothing too crazy, just learning
# about how while/for loops and lists work, focus on that, and youll succeed

# ------------- Python Reminders -------------
# you can always go to previous weeks to check up on anything you might not know!

# LISTS store multiple values in one variable
# books = ["Book A", "Book B", "Book C"]
# print(books[0])  -> prints "Book A"
# books.append("Book D")  -> adds to the end of the list

# WHILE LOOPS repeat until a condition changes
# count = 3
# while count > 0:
#     print("Counting down:", count)
#     count = count - 1

# FOR LOOPS are best when you know how many times to repeat
# for i in range(5):
#     print("i is", i)

# You can also use FOR LOOPS to go through each item in a list
# for book in books:
#     print("Reading:", book)
