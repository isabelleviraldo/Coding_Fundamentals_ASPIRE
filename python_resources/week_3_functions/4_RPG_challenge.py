# Mini RPG Adventure
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Create a simple RPG battle game.
# Your game must include:
#
#   1. At least ONE input from the user (example: choose your name, choose an action)
#   2. At least ONE if/else statement (example: check if you or the monster is alive)
#   3. At least ONE function (example: attack, heal, or roll a dice)
#   4. Use the python standard main function (the if __name__="__main__": thing from earlier)
#
# RPG games let the player make choices and see the result.
# Focus on making a few simple options, not a huge game.
# You can always expand later (add more monsters, items, etc.).
#
# Don’t stress, this is just practice with functions, if/else, and inputs.
# As long as you have those pieces, you’ve succeeded!

# ------------- Python Reminders -------------
# input() lets you ask the user for something
# name = input("What is your name? ")

# if/else lets you make decisions
# if something == "yes":
#     print("You said yes!")
# else:
#     print("You said no!")

# functions let you reuse code
# def roll_dice():
#     return 4   # (pretend we rolled a dice)

# f-strings let you print variables inside strings
# print(f"Hello {name}!")

# if you want to use random numbers, you can put this at the top of your code
# import random

# to use random you can do this:
# print(random.randint(1, 6))   # random number from 1 to 6

# -------------------------------------------

# begin coding here...
