# Choose Your Own Adventure
# -------------------------------------------
# 
# Create a simple "choose your own adventure" story.
# Your story must include:
# 
#   1. At least ONE input from the user
#   2. At least ONE if/else statement
#   3. At least ONE match/case
# 
# Choose your own adventure stories are supposed to make the user feel like they are
# impacting the story, so you want the program to respond to the result of their action
# just think about different choices that a user could make that would change a story
#
# Also, dont stress, this is just a little program, nothing too crazy, just learning
# about how if/else and match/case statements work, focus on that, and youll succeed

# ------------- Python Reminders -------------
# This is a comment, python ignores lines that start with (#)

# input() lets you ask the user for something
# name = input("What is your name? ")

# if/else lets you make decisions
# if something == "yes":
#     print("You said yes!")
# else:
#     print("You said no!")

# match/case is like a switch statement
# choice = input("Choose an option: ")
# match choice:
#     case "a":
#         print("You chose option A")
#     case "b":
#         print("You chose option B")
#     case _:
#         print("You chose something else")

# f-strings let you print variables inside strings
# print(f"Hello {name}!")
